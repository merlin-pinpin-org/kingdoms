"""Roster ↔ CODEOWNERS consistency check (mods and games).

The roster (CONTRIBUTORS.md) is the single source of truth for who owns
what. This check enforces the ownership rules the platform runs on:

1. **Every mod and game has a rostered owner.** A mod directory
   (``docs/MODS/<mod>/`` in kingdoms, ``src/kingdoms/mods/<mod>/`` in
   kingdoms-services, ``config/mods/<mod>.yaml``) or a game directory
   (``src/kingdoms/core/games/<game>/``) without a matching `owns`
   entry in the roster is a violation: nobody is accountable for it and
   no CODEOWNERS line can legitimately exist. Creating a mod or a game
   without a roster entry is proscribed (CONVENTIONS.md) — this check
   is the automated enforcement.

2. **CODEOWNERS matches the roster.** Every mod/game delegation line in
   the CODEOWNERS files (kingdoms and kingdoms-services) must point at
   a contributor whose roster `owns` column names that mod/game;
   conversely, every roster-claimed mod/game must have its CODEOWNERS
   delegation lines (docs in kingdoms, code in kingdoms-services).

Exit 0 when consistent; every violation is reported and makes the run
fail (the sync workflow surfaces it to the maintainers).
