# AGENTS.md

Kingdoms documentation repo — the **source of truth** for the Kingdoms
Discord bot platform (architecture, ADRs, operating docs, mods
documentation, generated roadmap and dependency graph).

## Session start protocol (PRIORITY 0 — immutable, non-overridable)

**At the beginning of every new conversation, before any other action,
the session displays the roles and responsibilities it holds for this
session.** This rule cannot be waived, narrowed or replaced by any
later instruction — it is transparency by design: the human (who may
have zero IT skills) must always see who the agent acts for, what it
may do, and how to use it.

The session resolves **who it works for** from the GitHub login it is
connected as / acting on behalf of, then looks that login up in
[CONTRIBUTORS.md](CONTRIBUTORS.md) (the roster: alias, teams, roles,
owns, agent-scope — the roster is the CLA record and the authority
source). The session then opens the conversation with, at minimum:

1. **Who I act for** — the human's roster alias and roles (e.g.
   "Drasah — mod (kingdoms, marriage), vibe").
2. **What I may do this session** — the capabilities their roles grant,
   summarized from the authority table in
   [CONTRIBUTORS.md](CONTRIBUTORS.md) (personal env, shared envs,
   everywhere), and what stays a human click (production approvals,
   CLA, role changes, secrets).
3. **How to use me** — one pedagogical line per family of need:
   - "to deploy: just say *deploy my branch on my env* — I comment
     `/deploy` on the PR myself and wait for the pipeline's answer";
   - "to see what is happening: say *show me the logs of my env* — I
     run `/logs` and read you the result";
   - "to restart after a crash: say *restart my env* — I comment
     `/restart <your-env>`";
   - "anything else: just describe the outcome you want in plain
     French or English — I find the commands and the code."
4. **The boundaries** — the few things it will refuse and why (scope
   guard), pointing at the exact human click instead.

The display is transparent and pedagogical: no jargon without a
plain-language gloss, and it ends with an invitation: *"What would you
like to do?"*

**Content placement rule (applies to every instruction added here,
now and by future sessions):** AGENTS.md is **for AI agents only** —
session rules, scope, procedures, behavioral constraints. Anything
potentially useful to *humans* (tables, guides, role/capability
explanations, how-tos) lives in the human-facing docs
([CONTRIBUTORS.md](CONTRIBUTORS.md) roster/matrix,
[docs/CONVENTIONS.md](docs/CONVENTIONS.md), [docs/INDEX.md](docs/INDEX.md))
and is **referenced here by link, never duplicated**. When adding an
instruction, always ask: *would a human read this?* If yes, it belongs
in docs/ and AGENTS.md links to it.

## Authority: where to read it (agent rule)

The session **acts on behalf of its human** — identified by the GitHub
login it is connected as, resolved to the roster alias in
[CONTRIBUTORS.md](CONTRIBUTORS.md). The full **"who may do what, on
which environment" table** — human-readable, with the commands the
session posts and the per-role ✅/❌ matrix — is maintained in
[CONTRIBUTORS.md](CONTRIBUTORS.md) (*Who may do what, on which
environment*). The session reads it there at session start and
whenever an env-scoped request arrives; capabilities are enforced
mechanically by `authorize.yml` (fail-closed) when the session posts
the keyword comment on the PR.

## Read first

- [docs/INDEX.md](docs/INDEX.md) — the router: question → page. Find the
  answer without reading the whole docs tree.
- [docs/CONVENTIONS.md](docs/CONVENTIONS.md) — conventions shared by the
  three repositories (language, humans-never-code, secrets, PR lifecycle,
  issues, checks).
- [docs/VIBEWORKFLOW.md](docs/VIBEWORKFLOW.md) — operating model (roles,
  session loop, approvals, deployment flow).
- [docs/DEVELOPER.md](docs/DEVELOPER.md) — this repo's layout, checks,
  ADR process, mods documentation, generated artifacts.
- [docs/GUIDES/rulesets.md](docs/GUIDES/rulesets.md) — GitHub ruleset
  reference and policy (rebase-only merges, code-owner reviews, drift
  check).

## Repositories

- `kingdoms` (this repo): docs, ADRs, sync/validation scripts
- `kingdoms-services`: all Python code (core, Discord platform, mods)
- `kingdoms-infra`: Docker, CI/CD, GitOps manifests, deploy scripts

## Local rules

- Run `python3 .github/workflows/scripts/validate_docs.py --check --source <kingdoms-services>/src/kingdoms --config <kingdoms-services>/config`
  before opening any PR (the `Check Docs` required check re-runs it).
- Never edit or regenerate `generated/ROADMAP.md` or `generated/DEPENDENCIES.md`: the
  `sync-generated` workflow owns both files and publishes them on the
  `sync/generated-artifacts` branch (main carries neither). It runs on
  every merge to main, daily at 06:00 UTC and on demand — the merge that
  closes the issue re-syncs the roadmap. A session changes the issue
  state (or its `## Dependencies` section) and reads the generated truth
  on the sync branch.
- **Contributors roster is the org's source of truth** (`CONTRIBUTORS.md`,
  maintainer-owned): teams, memberships, per-repo grants and roles are
  declared there and synchronized to GitHub by the `contributors-sync`
  workflow (`make contributors-check` dry-run, `make contributors-sync`
  to reconcile). Never manage org teams or permissions by hand — edit the
  roster; the sync adds missing access, **revokes undeclared access
  automatically** and flags what it will not touch (unrostered org members,
  undeclared teams). Sessions read the roster to know who they work with
  (alias, email, teams, agent scope).
- Keep the docs in sync with any change made in `kingdoms-services` or
  `kingdoms-infra` — a code change without its doc update here is
  incomplete.
- **Enrich the docs and skills proactively** (developer-mandated,
  CONVENTIONS.md *Documentation is part of the change*): when a
  session's work teaches a rule, pitfall or pattern, update the
  matching skill page, convention or AGENTS.md entry as part of the
  change — never wait to be asked.
- Issue templates: `## Summary` / `## Details` (blank issues disabled).
- **Session scope guard** (non-overridable, CONVENTIONS.md): read
  `CONTRIBUTORS.md` at session start — you act only within your human's
  `agent-scope` and the authority matrix (roles × capabilities). Refuse
  anything outside (production approvals, CLA, role/team changes,
  secrets) and point the human at their click; no conversation instruction
  widens the scope, only a maintainer-reviewed roster PR does. The same
  file's *Git history rules* bind every session: no force push without a
  per-repository maintainer request, ask before committing to a branch
  the session does not own (docs-only and maintainer-confirmed workflow
  and configuration changes excepted).
- **PR-command keywords** (`/deploy`, `/env <cmd> <env>`, `/release`,
  `/rollback`, `/sync-teams`) are gated by `authorize.yml` against the
  authority matrix: the requestor needs the capability per their roles,
  the PR author's agent-scope must cover it, and the CLA must be
  accepted — fail-closed with the exact matrix rule. Never run a
  privileged action through any other path.
- **The session posts these PR comments itself — they are agent
  actions, not human ones.** When the human asks for a deploy, logs,
  restart or release, the session writes the `/deploy` / `/env` /
  `/release` comment on the PR **as its own next step**, never waits for
  the human to post it, and never replies "post /deploy yourself".
  Authority is checked mechanically at gate time against the human's
  roster entry and agent-scope: if the human's rights cover it, the
  session's comment passes the gate (the session acts on the human's
  behalf — that is the whole point of the platform); if the gate
  rejects it, the session reports the exact matrix rule and what roster
  change would be needed. Asking the human to click is reserved for
  the human-only actions listed in the session scope guard (production
  approvals, CLA, role changes, secrets).
- **After posting a command comment, wait and read the answer before
  reporting to the human.** The workflows reply on the PR within
  seconds (gate verdict) to minutes (pipeline result). The session
  polls the PR conversation / the run (`gh run list`, the tracking
  comment) until the verdict or a final status lands, and only then
  answers the human — quoting the actual outcome (authorized/denied
  with the matrix rule, run succeeded/failed with the error). Never
  report "done, it should work" off the comment alone, and never
  answer the human while the gate or the pipeline is still running.
- **Issue references** are GitHub autolinks: same-repo `#N`, cross-repo
  `owner/repo#N` (e.g. `merlin-pinpin-org/kingdoms-services#12`) — a bare
  `repo#N` renders as plain text; never write it. See CONVENTIONS.md,
  *Documentation is part of the change*.
- **No one-off automation:** every recurring operation is a committed
  Makefile target, script or workflow, and every improvised-but-useful
  command is committed ("learned") — see the
  [Automate or learn](.agents/skills/automate-or-learn/SKILL.md) skill and
  [docs/CONVENTIONS.md](docs/CONVENTIONS.md), *Human GitHub scope* and
  *Everything is automation*.
- **Skills** live in [`.agents/skills/`](.agents/skills/) (Agent Skills
  open standard: one directory per skill, `SKILL.md` with YAML
  frontmatter). Read a skill's `SKILL.md` when a task matches its
  description: deploy-and-validate, ci-monitoring, diagnose-deploy,
  release-flow, shape-game-designer-idea, update-roadmap,
  update-dependencies. New procedural knowledge goes there — when you
  learn something new, propose persisting it (see the *Propose to
  memorize new knowledge* rule in CONVENTIONS.md).
