# Mod catalogue

One page listing **every mod idea** on the platform, at its current maturity
level — the entry point for the game designers to **browse, compare and
prioritize** ideas. Each entry is one row: maturity, one-line description,
categories, and links to the detailed docs/issues.

The repo is the memory: the catalogue row only summarizes; the linked issue or
doc holds the decisions.

## Maturity levels

A mod moves up one level at a time; each level has an entry requirement.

| Level | Meaning | Entry requirement |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| **1 — Vague idea** | A raw game-designer idea, no shaping yet | None — write the row |
| **2 — Shaped** | Challenged into an automatable, explainable issue (self-contained, checkable acceptance criteria) | A tracking issue in `kingdoms-services` |
| **3 — Specified** | Rules, environment and workflows written under `docs/MODS/<mod>/` (TEMPLATE-based) | Mod docs directory |
| **4 — Scoped** | Picked by a milestone: implementation sliced into sub-tasks with dependencies | Sub-task issues + a milestone |
| **5 — Developed** | Implemented, tested, shipped in a release | Released version |

Categories: `game` (gameplay), `social` (community), `organizer` (event/orga
tooling), `platform` (bot/infra capability), `money` (touches payments —
requires the [monetization plan](../PLANS/monetization.md) gate).

## Prioritization notes

- **ladder** and **kingdoms** carry the v0.4.0 milestone — highest priority.
- **coaching** is shaped and ready to be picked up by a milestone; its
  monetization axes are parked ([PLANS/monetization.md](../PLANS/monetization.md)),
  so v1 needs no payment work.
- Mods with a `money` category require the monetization gate (community
  consultation + ADR) **before** any implementation.
