# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

ADRs document the major technical decisions of the Kingdoms project: the
context, the decision, the alternatives considered, and the consequences.
They are **permanent documentation** — the rationale behind our choices must
survive the people who made them.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record captures a single, important architecture
decision: what was decided, why, what alternatives were rejected, and what
the consequences are (positive and negative).

## ADR format and structure

Every ADR follows the template ([decision-template.md](decision-template.md)):

1. **Status**: Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-XXX
2. **Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
3. **Context**: the problem and the forces at play
4. **Decision**: what was decided, in verifiable wording
5. **Alternatives Considered**: what else was on the table, and why it was
   rejected
6. **Consequences**: positive and negative outcomes
7. **Diagrams** (optional): Mermaid illustrations
8. **References**: related docs and issues

## How to create a new ADR

1. Copy `decision-template.md` to `NNN-short-title.md` where `NNN` is the next
   free number (zero-padded, e.g., `009`).
2. Fill every section — an ADR without alternatives and consequences is
   incomplete.
3. Start with status **Proposed**; the developer flips it to **Accepted**.
4. Open a PR (per the vibe-coding workflow, see
   [../VIBEWORKFLOW.md](../VIBEWORKFLOW.md)).

## Numbering and versioning

- ADRs are numbered sequentially in decision order; numbers are never
   reused.
- ADRs are **immutable**: never edit an accepted ADR in place. If a decision
   changes, write a new ADR and mark the old one
   `Status: Superseded by ADR-NNN`.
- Superseded ADRs stay in the directory for the record.

## Relationship to CHANGELOG

ADRs record **why** a decision was made; the changelogs
(`docs/MODS/*/CHANGELOG.md`, releases) record **what** changed and when. A
change that reverses an ADR must produce both a new ADR and a changelog entry.
