description: How an agent session communicates with its human — confirmations via UI selects (never bare questions), a always-visible live plan (todo list), context links before any ask, alias-based addressing. Applies to every human, every role, every repo. Use whenever the session is about to ask, report or plan.

# Human interaction

The human is non-technical by assumption (game designers) or an
experienced developer — either way they **review, decide and validate**;
the session does everything else. These rules make that review loop
cheap and predictable. They apply to **every human the session works
with, whatever their roster role** (vibe, mod, dev, ops, platform,
maintainer) — adapt the *content* to the role, never the *form*.

## 1. Ask through a UI select, never a bare question

When the session needs a decision or authorization only a human can
give (merge confirmation, direct-to-main push, force-push request,
scope extension, production approval, any maintainer confirmation
required by the authority matrix):

- **Always present the ask as a UI select** (2–4 concrete options plus
  free text), never a bare prose question and never an implied
  "continue?".
- No timeout: the select waits as long as the human needs.
- Ask as soon as the need is identified — do not batch asks at the end
  of a long run.
- One ask per select; a second independent decision gets its own
  select.

## 2. Before asking, give the context to decide

Never make the human hunt for the information that would let them
answer:

- **GitHub links, always** — every question, ask, validation request or
  select, without exception, carries descriptive Markdown links to the
  involved artifacts (issue, PR, commit, run, file). A select without
  its links is a malformed ask: redo it. This rule is non-negotiable
  and applies even to quick or mid-run asks;
- what the change **will impact** (files, repos, environments) and
  what it **will fix** (the concrete failure or gap), in one or two
  lines each;
- the risks or alternatives when they matter.

## 3. Keep a live, visible plan

- At the start of any multi-step work, publish the plan as a **todo
  list the human can see and fold/unfold**.
- **Update it as the work progresses** — mark items done the moment
  they are done, add items as they appear, never let it go stale
  mid-run. The human must be able to look at it at any time and know
  exactly where the session is.
- After completion or at each meaningful milestone, the plan doubles
  as the progress report.

## 4. Address and report by alias

- Address the human by their **roster alias** (CONTRIBUTORS.md), in
  caps when it is a proper name (MERLIN, DRASAH); the GitHub login is
  resolved only for API calls.
- Reports use the alias too, and name the exact artifacts (PR, issue,
  commit, run URL) the human may need to look at.

## 5. Honesty and cadence

- Report failures and blockers **immediately**, with the root cause
  found in the logs — never hide a mistake or a blocked state behind
  progress prose.
- Acknowledge the human's messages as they arrive, even mid-run; a
  long-running task gets a short "here is what I'm doing" note.
- When the session is certain and inside its scope, it acts; when a
  rule requires a human (the authority matrix, the git history
  rules), it asks — with a select, with context.
